# OpenAI's GPT-5: Development Progress and Expected Release Timeline

OpenAI has confirmed that GPT-5, the next iteration of their flagship language model, is actively under development. CEO Sam Altman has provided several updates indicating significant progress and ambitious goals for the new model.

## Release Timeline

According to multiple sources and statements from OpenAI:

- Training phase began in early 2024
- Expected release: Late 2024 or early 2025
- Extensive safety testing will precede public release

## Key Improvements

Altman has highlighted several areas of advancement for GPT-5:

- "Significant leap forward" in reasoning capabilities
- Enhanced natural language processing
- Improved reliability and accuracy
- Expanded multi-modal capabilities
- Customization options for different user needs

## Pricing and Accessibility

While specific pricing details haven't been announced, industry experts expect:

- Continued subscription model similar to ChatGPT Plus ($20/month)
- Initial access likely through ChatGPT Plus or Copilot Pro
- Potential for GPT-4 to become more accessible as GPT-5 launches

## Development Focus

OpenAI emphasizes two key priorities in GPT-5's development:

1. **Enhanced Reasoning**: Addressing current limitations in GPT-4's reasoning capabilities
2. **Customization**: Enabling different styles and assumptions to meet varied user needs

"Right now, GPT-4 can reason only in extremely limited ways, and its reliability is also limited," Altman stated, indicating that GPT-5 aims to address these core challenges.

## Safety Measures

The development process includes:

- Multiple phases of safety testing
- Internal and external "red teaming"
- Rigorous evaluation of strengths and vulnerabilities
