> We should have a 4.x model ( maybe still called 4.5, my old friend ) in October. 
>
> The big boy gpt 5, I've heard as early as December but for your sanity I would have Q1/Q2 2025 just in case.

## Key Takeaways

- An intermediate update (version 4.x or 4.5) is expected in October 2024
- GPT-5 could potentially arrive as early as December 2024
- A more conservative estimate places GPT-5's release in Q1/Q2 2025
- Current models should be evaluated with future improvements in mind

The prediction suggests OpenAI is maintaining its pattern of releasing intermediate model updates before major version launches, similar to the GPT-4 rollout strategy.
